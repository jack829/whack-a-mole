## To run
Requirements
* `node >= v8.6`
* NPM

* Note: checkout the branch `without-webpack` to skip the following steps

### Steps:
1. From the command line, clone the repo
* for `ssh`:
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:jack829/whack-a-mole.git
  ```
* for `https`:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jack829/whack-a-mole.git`
  ```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. To run in `dev` mode (for live reloading if you feel like playing with the code)
```
npm run dev
```
* Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser

4. To build the static production build
```
npm run build
```

* Copy the file path for `dist/index.html` and paste it into your browser

## Notes on implementation
* I decided to go with an object oriented approach because, to me, it was the shorter jump conceptually for tracking game state. I opted to use prototypal methods for functionality that required access to instance state rather than using `.call` or `.apply` to invoke functions scoped to each individual file module. The pitfall is that these "private methods" (indicated by a preceding `_`) are exposed to external modules.

* Things I'd still like to do:
  * Create more separation of concerns in the JS. Right now the Mole and Game modules are acting as both "model" and "view" and many of the methods trigger both state changes and UI updates.
  * Do more "componentizing" by breaking the single index.html file into individual templates tied to their respective components. Restructure the `src` files to reflect components rather than being split by extension type.
  * Add in unit testing. This would aid in the separation of concerns mentioned in the first bullet point.
  * For fun: refactor the entire thing to use functional style :).
